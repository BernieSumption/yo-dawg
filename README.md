# yo-dawg

A Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG) library for C.

This code was a weekend experiment, written for a project that never reached production - the idea was
to use it in an iOS boggle puzzle solver.

This project consists of:

* A compressed binary format for representing a DAWG in C
* Functions for traversing the graph
* A command line utility
